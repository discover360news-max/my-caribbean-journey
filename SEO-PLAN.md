# My Caribbean Journey — SEO Plan

**Created:** February 2026
**Goal:** Position mycaribbeanjourney.com as the definitive Caribbean voice for the diaspora, curious travellers, and those called to the islands.

---

## The Position

> "The definitive Caribbean voice for the diaspora, the curious, and those called to the islands."

Generic Caribbean travel sites (TripAdvisor, Lonely Planet, Visit Tobago) win on scale and budget. Quincy wins on **authenticity and depth** — a living, breathing Caribbean perspective you can't manufacture. This strategy leans into that.

**The niche:** Caribbean identity + Tobago expertise, expanding outward. This is a category of one.

---

## Target Audiences

- Caribbean diaspora abroad (US, UK, Canada) — looking to reconnect with roots
- Tourists planning trips — researching Caribbean destinations
- Expats & relocators — considering or already living in the Caribbean
- Culture & identity seekers — Caribbean literature, folklore, history, identity

**Primary conversion goal:** Book sales (Amazon — I Am Tobago + future titles)

---

## Technical SEO Status

### Already in place ✅
- Canonical URLs on all pages
- Open Graph / Twitter Cards implemented
- Schema markup (WebSite, Organization, Book, BlogPosting)
- robots.txt pointing to sitemap
- sitemap.xml auto-generated by Eleventy (includes all blog posts)
- Blog infrastructure live via Eleventy at `/blog/`

### Fixed ✅
- Schema logo URL corrected (was pointing to non-existent `favicon.png`)
- Duplicate/broken favicon link tag removed from `index.html`
- `privacy-policy` added to Eleventy passthrough (was missing from `_site/` entirely)

### Remaining gaps
- [ ] Quincy's Amazon Author Central page should link back to mycaribbeanjourney.com
- [ ] Add `sameAs` to Organization schema once social profiles are established
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console (one-time task)
- [ ] Add Google Search Console verification tag to `index.html`

## Strategy: Three Phases

---

### Phase 1 — Own Tobago (Months 1–6)

**Goal:** Become the #1 non-government result for Tobago culture, folklore, and expat resources.

Tobago is systematically underserved in search. Jamaica has thousands of competing sites. Tobago has a handful — and none with the cultural depth Quincy can provide. This is the beachhead.

**The single most important lever:** Regular content in `/blog/`. The site has 3 static pages — it cannot rank for hundreds of searches without content.

#### Target Keywords — Tobago Cluster

| Keyword | Intent | Content type |
|---|---|---|
| `tobago folklore` | Culture / research | Long essay — Quincy's expertise |
| `tobago cultural traditions` | Culture / research | Guide or essay |
| `tobago expat guide` | Expat planning | Expanded guide page |
| `moving to tobago` | Expat decision | Long-form guide |
| `tobago things to do` | Tourist planning | Curated list article |
| `tobago hidden gems` | Tourist planning | Essay / list hybrid |
| `tobago local food` | Tourist / culture | Essay with recommendations |
| `tobago history` | Research | Long-form historical essay |
| `i am tobago book` | Brand / direct | Already covered by book page |
| `tobago myths and legends` | Culture / folklore | Story-format content |

#### Priority Content — Phase 1

1. **"The Folklore of Tobago: Spirits, Stories, and the Soul of the Island"**
   - Targets: `tobago folklore`, `tobago myths and legends`
   - Anchors the book, highest authority topic for Quincy
2. **"Moving to Tobago: An Honest Expat Guide"**
   - Targets: `moving to tobago`, `tobago expat guide`
3. **"What to Eat in Tobago: A Local's Guide"**
   - Targets: `tobago local food`, `tobago street food`
4. **"The History of Tobago in 10 Defining Moments"**
   - Targets: `tobago history`
5. **"Tobago vs. Trinidad: What Nobody Tells You"**
   - Targets comparison searches — high diaspora interest
6. **"Hidden Tobago: The Places Tourists Miss"**
   - Targets: `tobago hidden gems`

---

### Phase 2 — Caribbean Identity & Diaspora (Months 4–12)

**Goal:** Capture diaspora and culture searches. Establish Quincy as a Caribbean intellectual voice.

#### Target Keywords — Caribbean Identity Cluster

| Keyword | Intent | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
| `caribbean cultural identity` | Research / diaspora | Medium |
| `caribbean diaspora experience` | Personal / community | Low–Medium |
| `what is caribbean culture` | Educational | Medium |
| `caribbean mythology` | Research / culture | Low |
| `growing up caribbean` | Identity / nostalgia | Low |
| `best books about caribbean culture` | Discovery | Medium |
| `caribbean identity essay` | Academic / personal | Low |

#### Priority Content — Phase 2

1. **"What Does Caribbean Identity Actually Mean?"** — flagship essay, wide reach
2. **"10 Books Every Caribbean Diaspora Reader Should Own"** — includes I Am Tobago, great for backlinks
3. **"Growing Up Between Two Worlds: The Caribbean Diaspora Experience"** — personal, shareable
4. **"Caribbean Mythology: The Gods and Spirits Our Grandparents Remembered"** — low competition, high cultural depth
5. **"Why Tobago Is the Caribbean's Best Kept Secret"** — bridges Phase 1 & 2

---

### Phase 3 — Island-by-Island Expansion (Month 9+)

**Goal:** Replicate the Tobago guide model across other islands. Become the Caribbean directory.

Once `/my-tobago-guide/` has traction, expand to:
- `/my-trinidad-guide/`
- `/my-barbados-guide/`
- `/my-st-lucia-guide/`

Each guide targets `[island] expat guide`, `[island] best resources`, `[island] local businesses`. These pages accumulate quietly and compound over time.

---

## Conversion Path

Every SEO visitor has a route to a book sale:

```
Search: "tobago folklore"
  → Reads essay on /blog/tobago-folklore/
  → Sees inline CTA: "Go deeper — I Am Tobago explores these stories in full"
  → Clicks through to /i-am-tobago/
  → Buys on Amazon
```

**Every blog post needs:**
1. An inline text link to the book or guide mid-article (natural, not salesy)
2. A bottom CTA block pointing to the relevant book/guide
3. A newsletter capture (long game — own the audience)

---

## Off-Page Authority (Backlinks)

Google won't fully trust the site until credible sites link to it.

| Source type | Examples | How to get links |
|---|---|---|
| Caribbean diaspora media | Caribbean Life, The Gleaner, Caribbean Beat | Pitch essays or interviews |
| Book review blogs | Caribbean book bloggers, Black book communities | Send review copies |
| Travel blogs | Tobago-focused travel bloggers | Guest posts or resource mentions |
| Academic / library sites | Caribbean studies departments | Long-form cultural content attracts these naturally |
| Amazon Author Page | Amazon Author Central | Link back to mycaribbeanjourney.com — high domain authority |

**Highest-leverage single move:** Set up Amazon Author Central and link it to mycaribbeanjourney.com. Amazon's domain authority is enormous.

---

## Content Calendar

Recommended cadence: **2 posts per month** — sustainable, compounds meaningfully.

| Month | Piece 1 | Piece 2 |
|---|---|---|
| March 2026 | Tobago folklore essay | Tobago vs Trinidad |
| April 2026 | Moving to Tobago expat guide | What to eat in Tobago |
| May 2026 | Hidden Tobago | Tobago history |
| June 2026 | Caribbean identity (flagship essay) | Best Caribbean books list |
| July 2026 | Growing up Caribbean diaspora | Caribbean mythology |
| Aug 2026+ | Trinidad guide launch | Caribbean identity essays continue |

---

## The Three Core Levers

1. **Build content in /blog/** — this is the entire game. Without new content, the site is invisible to 95% of relevant searches.
2. **Write in Quincy's real voice** — authentic, specific, Caribbean. Not generic travel copy. This is what Google's E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) rewards.
3. **Internal links** — every essay should link to the book page and the guide. Every page should link to relevant essays. Tells Google what the site is about and keeps visitors moving toward a sale.
