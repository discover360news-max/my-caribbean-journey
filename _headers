# This site uses fixed filenames (no content hashing), so HTML/CSS/JS
# must always be revalidated. Cloudflare returns a 304 Not Modified
# when nothing has changed — fast, but deploys are immediately visible.
#
# Images and video are safe for long cache: new uploads always get new
# filenames from the CMS, and video is replaced in-place rarely.
#
# Rules: last matching path wins.
