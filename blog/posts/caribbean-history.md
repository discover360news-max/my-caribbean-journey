The Caribbean was already old before Columbus arrived.

For thousands of years before any European ship crested the horizon, these islands were alive with the Arawak and Taíno peoples — farmers, fishermen, and storytellers who had been navigating this sea in dugout canoes long before it had a name on any European map. They grew cassava and sweet potato in mounded earthworks called *conucos*. They played a ball game called *batey* on ceremonial courts. They passed their cosmologies down through generations of ceremony and song.

They called this sea *Carib*, after the fierce and formidable people of the smaller islands to the south. And from that word — Carib — came the name the rest of the world would eventually use.

## The Encounter That Changed Everything

When Columbus sailed into the Bahamas in October 1492, he was looking for a western passage to Asia. He found something else entirely: a world of astonishing beauty and abundance that he had no framework to understand. He wrote in his journal that the people he encountered were "gentle and always laughing." He noted the parrots, the green mountains, the warm nights. And then, almost in the same breath, he noted how easily they might be conquered.

That note would become a blueprint.

Within fifty years of first contact, the Taíno population of Hispaniola had been reduced from an estimated 300,000 to fewer than 500. Disease did much of the killing, but the colonial enterprise — forced labour in gold mines, violence, displacement — did the rest. What Columbus had marvelled at was systematically dismantled in the name of commerce and crown.

## Sugar and the World Remade

The Caribbean's transformation into a plantation economy began in earnest in the seventeenth century, and it reshaped the entire Atlantic world. Sugar was the engine. Tobacco, indigo, and cotton came too, but sugar was king — a commodity so valuable that wars were fought over islands no bigger than a parish, and treaties were signed trading entire countries for the right to grow cane.

To work those fields, European powers reached into Africa. Over three centuries, somewhere between 12 and 15 million Africans were transported across the Atlantic in conditions designed to strip them of everything — language, name, family, homeland. Many died in the crossing. Those who survived were sold and worked in conditions of extreme brutality.

And yet they survived. And more than survived.

## What Survived the Middle Passage

Here is what the history books often miss: the enslaved people who crossed the Atlantic did not arrive empty. They brought memory with them. They brought rhythm. They brought knowledge of plants, of healing, of building, of cooking, of song. Much was lost — how could it not be, in such violence? But much was also preserved, adapted, transformed into something new and astonishing.

Creole languages bloomed across the islands, born from the collision of African tongues with English, French, Spanish, and Dutch. Drumming continued in the hills, coded and complex. Spiritual traditions like Vodou in Haiti, Orisha in Trinidad, and Kumina in Jamaica held communities together through the long night of enslavement. The food — the pepper sauces, the stewed meats, the ground provisions, the rice and peas — is African in its roots, shaped by what the islands offered and what the plantation permitted.

When we eat a roti in Trinidad, we taste the Indian indentureship era that followed emancipation. When we hear parang in Tobago, we hear the Spanish influence that predates the British. The Caribbean is not a single culture but a conversation between dozens — a conversation that has been ongoing for five hundred years and shows no sign of stopping.

## Emancipation and Its Aftermath

Slavery was abolished across the British Caribbean in 1834, though the "Apprenticeship" system that followed meant four more years of compulsory unpaid labour. Full emancipation came in 1838. In the French Caribbean, it came in 1848. Cuba, the last to hold enslaved people in the region, finally abolished the practice in 1886.

Emancipation was won, not simply granted. It was the result of rebellions — of Toussaint Louverture in Haiti, of Sam Sharpe in Jamaica, of Bussa in Barbados — of organising and resistance and sacrifice. It was also the result of economic argument and abolitionist pressure, and it arrived burdened with contradiction: the enslaved people were freed, but the plantation owners were compensated. In Britain, the descendants of those compensated slaveholders are still identifiable today.

What followed emancipation was a period of extraordinary creativity and also extraordinary hardship. Freed people left the estates wherever they could, built villages, established free communities, farmed their own land. The colonial powers responded by importing indentured labourers from India, China, Madeira, and West Africa — a different form of bonded labour, designed to keep the plantation economy alive. This is how Trinidad became what it is today: a place where Hindu temples and mosques stand within sight of churches, where the rhythms of tassa drumming and steel pan share the same street.

## The Sound of a People

I am a musician first. So when I think about Caribbean history, I think about music — because music is where the deepest history lives.

Calypso emerged in Trinidad in the nineteenth century as a form of social commentary, a way of speaking truth to power in song when other forms of speech were dangerous. The great calypsonians — Mighty Sparrow, Lord Kitchener, Calypso Rose — were not merely entertainers. They were journalists, philosophers, and political theorists. Their art required wit, memory, and courage.

And then there is the steel pan. Born in Trinidad in the 1930s and 40s, the steelpan is the only acoustic instrument invented in the twentieth century. It grew out of tamboo bamboo music, out of African drumming traditions, out of the colonial government's attempts to suppress Black cultural expression by banning drums. When drums were banned, people beat biscuit tins and garbage cans. When those were banned, they began shaping the bottoms of discarded oil drums  - made widely available during the United States military presence in Trinidad during World War II - into tuned instruments of extraordinary range and beauty.

The steelpan is the Caribbean in miniature: it takes the materials of oppression and makes something transcendent from them. It is the sound of what I mean when I say resilience.

## Independence and the Question Ahead

The twentieth century brought independence movements across the Caribbean. Haiti had been independent since 1804 — the first Black republic in the world, born from the only successful slave revolution in history — but for most of the islands, nationhood came in the 1960s. Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago in 1962. Barbados in 1966. Others followed through the 1970s and 80s.

Independence did not solve everything. Colonial economies leave deep marks. The Caribbean's geography — small islands, scattered across a vast sea — creates real challenges for trade and development. Many islands remain dependent on tourism, a fact that carries its own complicated weight. And climate change now threatens the very existence of some of the low-lying nations that barely won their sovereignty before the sea began to rise.

But independence did something essential: it gave the Caribbean the space to understand itself on its own terms. Caribbean writers — V.S. Naipaul, Derek Walcott, Jamaica Kincaid, Edwidge Danticat, Earl Lovelace — began telling the region's stories in their own voices. Caribbean scholars began writing Caribbean history from Caribbean perspectives. A literature and an art and a music emerged that were answerable to no colonial gaze.

## Why This History Matters

I grew up in Tobago when the island had just one traffic light. I ran down Sangsters Hill as a boy. I played steel pan at hotels, and I played organ in churches, and I listened to the old people talk. The stories they told were history — not the history in textbooks, but the living kind, the kind that knows whose grandfather was what, and which family came from where.

That kind of history is fragile. It lives in people, and people die. It lives in communities, and communities disperse. The Caribbean diaspora is scattered across London and New York and Toronto, and in all those cities, children grow up who have never tasted a golden apple or heard a parang or seen the lights of Scarborough from the sea at night.

This is why I write. Not to lecture, and not to preserve things under glass — culture is not a museum exhibit — but to keep the conversation going. The Caribbean's history is not only a history of what was done to its people. It is a history of what its people did in response: how they endured, how they created, how they laughed and loved and built something extraordinary out of the most difficult of materials.

That history deserves to be known. It deserves to be celebrated.

And it is very far from over.
