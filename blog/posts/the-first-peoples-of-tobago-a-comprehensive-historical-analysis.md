excerpt: The history of Tobago’s first peoples represents a tragic yet resilient
  arc of human migration, cultural richness, and fierce resistance. Long before
  the island became a pawn in European colonial struggles - changing hands a
  record 33 times - it was home to diverse indigenous groups who migrated from
  the South American mainland. These peoples, primarily the Ortoiroid, Saladoid,
  and later the Kalinago (Carib) and Lokono (Arawak), established complex
  societies deeply connected to the island's natural resources. This report
  explores their origins, their spiritual and social frameworks, and the
  multifaceted causes of their eventual decline.

## Origins and Migration Patterns

The settlement of Tobago occurred in several distinct waves, primarily originating from the **Orinoco River delta** in modern-day Venezuela.

| Period | Group | Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Archaic (c. 3500–1000 BC) | Ortoiroid | They were hunter-gatherers who relied on fishing and shellfish. They did not produce pottery but used stone tools. |
| Ceramic (c. 250 BC – 600 AD) | Saladoid | Named after the Saladero site in Venezuela. They introduced agriculture - notably cassava cultivation and produced highly decorative white-on-red pottery. |
| Late Ceramic (c. 1000 AD – Contact) | Suazey / Kalinago | Associated archaeologically with the Suazey material culture and historically with the Kalinago - often described by early Europeans as “Caribs.” They expanded through the Lesser Antilles and played a significant role in the region’s political and military landscape. |

Rather than representing isolated populations, these periods reflect overlapping waves of migration and cultural development. Movement through the southern Caribbean followed a “stepping stone” pattern from the South American coast to Trinidad, then to Tobago, and further north into the Antillean archipelago.

The island carried Indigenous names long before it was called Tobago. Some sources record Tavaco, possibly linked to a Y-shaped smoking pipe used in ritual practice. Others reference Aloubaéra or Urupina. Within this regional network, Tobago functioned as both a strategic position and an agricultural hub.

## Culture and Social Structure

Indigenous societies in Tobago were organized into autonomous villages, typically led by a chief. Among the Lokono, often referred to by Europeans as “Arawaks,” this leader was known as a cacique. Among the Kalinago, leadership structures differed but were similarly organized around recognized authority.

* **Daily Life**
  Their economy combined conuco agriculture, or mound farming, with fishing and hunting. They were skilled maritime navigators, constructing large dugout canoes capable of traveling between islands and the mainland.
* **Tobacco**
  Tobacco held a central place in their culture. It was used for recreation and in sacred rituals. The island’s modern name preserves a linguistic trace of this practice.
* **Social Organization**
  Historical accounts suggest that Lokono communities tended toward more sedentary and hierarchical structures, while Kalinago societies were often more egalitarian during peacetime but highly structured during conflict.

## Spiritual Beliefs and Cosmology

The spiritual world of Tobago’s first peoples was populated by ancestral forces and spiritual beings. Their religious life was polytheistic and animistic, centered on the concept of Zemis.

> Zemis were not merely gods but physical manifestations of spiritual power, often carved from wood, stone, or bone. They were believed to influence weather, fertility, and the health of the community.

Key elements of their belief system included:

* **Shamanism**
  The Bohique, or shaman, acted as a mediator between the physical and spiritual realms. Through the use of tobacco and hallucinogenic snuffs such as cohoba, they entered altered states to consult the spirits.
* **Dualism**
  They recognized a moral balance between benevolent forces and malevolent entities. Among the Kalinago, the feared Maybouya represented misfortune and required ritual appeasement.
* **Afterlife**
  They believed in life beyond death. The virtuous were thought to journey to a peaceful realm, while the wicked were condemned to wander.

## The European Encounter and Resistance

Tobago’s Indigenous population did not disappear quietly. Unlike many other Caribbean islands where Indigenous societies were rapidly subdued, the peoples of Tobago resisted European settlement for more than two centuries.

In 1637, both British and Dutch attempts to establish permanent settlements were violently repelled. A Zeeland warship in 1628 reportedly lost fifty-four men in a single encounter with Tobago’s defenders.

Strategic alliances were formed when necessary. The Kalinago proved adept at leveraging European rivalries, at times aligning with French or Dutch interests to counter English expansion.

For much of the seventeenth century, Tobago was considered too dangerous for sustained European settlement. At various points it was declared neutral territory due to persistent Indigenous resistance.

## The Full Arc: Decline and Extinction

The decline of Tobago’s first peoples was not the result of a single event but of compounding forces.

**Epidemic Disease**
Old World diseases such as smallpox, measles, and influenza proved devastating. With no natural immunity, Indigenous populations were sometimes reduced by as much as eighty to ninety percent within a generation.

**Constant Warfare**
As Tobago became the most fought-over island in the Caribbean, changing colonial hands thirty-three times, Indigenous communities were repeatedly caught in conflict. Raids, scorched-earth tactics, and village destruction became frequent realities.

**Enslavement and Displacement**
Many were captured and transported to other colonies. Some were sold into labor in places such as Barbados or Martinique. Others were sent to Trinidad or the mainland provinces of Venezuela. In some cases, Indigenous captives were absorbed into plantation systems in Suriname. Others fled to mainland South America or to Kalinago territories in Dominica and St. Vincent.

**Colonial Consolidation**
By the late eighteenth century, British control was firmly established. The remaining Indigenous population was gradually absorbed into the expanding society of enslaved Africans and European settlers or marginalized to the point that an independent Indigenous presence on the island effectively ended.

## Legacy

While their independent political presence in Tobago ended in the eighteenth century, the legacy of the first peoples remains embedded in the island’s identity.

Archaeological sites across the island continue to yield artifacts that reflect their craftsmanship and patterns of settlement. Linguistically, the name Tobago itself stands as a permanent reminder of earlier Indigenous names and traditions.

Today, the Santa Rosa First Peoples Community in Arima, Trinidad, serves as a custodian of this heritage, representing descendants of those who survived the colonial era.
