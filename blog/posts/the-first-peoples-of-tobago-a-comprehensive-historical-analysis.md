excerpt: The history of Tobago’s first peoples represents a tragic yet resilient
  arc of human migration, cultural richness, and fierce resistance. Long before
  the island became a pawn in European colonial struggles—changing hands a
  record 33 times—it was home to diverse indigenous groups who migrated from the
  South American mainland. These peoples, primarily the Ortoiroid, Saladoid, and
  later the Kalinago (Carib) and Lokono (Arawak), established complex societies
  deeply connected to the island's natural resources. This report explores their
  origins, their spiritual and social frameworks, and the multifaceted causes of
  their eventual decline.

### Origins and Migration Patterns

The settlement of Tobago occurred in several distinct waves, primarily originating from the **Orinoco River delta** in modern-day Venezuela.

| Period | Group | Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Archaic (c. 3500–1000 BC) | Ortoiroid | The earliest known inhabitants. They were hunter-gatherers who relied on fishing and shellfish. They did not produce pottery but used stone tools. |
| Ceramic (c. 250 BC – 600 AD) | Saladoid | Named after the Saladero site in Venezuela. They introduced agriculture (notably cassava) and highly decorative |
| Late Ceramic (c. 1000 AD – Contact) | Suazey / Kalinago | A more militaristic group that migrated up the Lesser Antilles. They are often associated with the "Carib" identity described by early Europeans. |




These migrations followed a "stepping stone" pattern from the South American coast to Trinidad, then to Tobago, and further north into the Antillean archipelago. Tobago, which they called **Tavaco** (referring to the Y-shaped pipe used for smoking), served as a vital strategic and agricultural hub.

### Culture and Social Structure

The indigenous societies of Tobago were organized into autonomous villages, often led by a hereditary or merit-based chief known as a **cacique** (among Arawaks) or a **ubutu** (among Caribs).

* **Daily Life**: Their economy was based on a combination of "conuco" agriculture (mound farming), fishing, and hunting. They were expert maritime navigators, constructing large dugout canoes capable of traveling between islands and the mainland.
* **Tobacco**: Tobacco held a central place in their culture, used both for recreation and in sacred rituals. The name "Tobago" itself is a linguistic legacy of this practice.
* **Social Organization**: While the Lokono were generally perceived as more sedentary and hierarchical, the Kalinago were noted for their egalitarian social structures during peacetime and their highly organized military hierarchies during conflict.

### Spiritual Beliefs and Cosmology

The spiritual world of Tobago's first peoples was populated by a pantheon of spirits and ancestral forces. Their religion was polytheistic and animistic, centered on the concept of **Zemis**.

> "The Zemis were not merely gods but the physical manifestations of spirits, often carved from wood, stone, or bone. They controlled the weather, the fertility of the soil, and the health of the community."

Key aspects of their belief system included:

1. **Shamanism**: The **Bohique** (shaman) acted as a mediator between the physical and spiritual realms. Through the use of tobacco and hallucinogenic snuffs like cohoba, they entered trances to consult the spirits.
2. **Dualism**: They believed in a constant struggle between benevolent forces and malevolent entities. The Kalinago feared the **Maybouya**, a personification of evil and misfortune that required constant appeasement through ritual.
3. **Afterlife**: They believed in a life after death where the souls of the virtuous would reside in a peaceful land, while the wicked were doomed to wander.

### The European Encounter and Resistance

Tobago’s indigenous population was uniquely defiant. Unlike many other Caribbean islands where the native population was quickly subdued, the peoples of Tobago fought a protracted war of resistance for over two centuries.

* **Early Defiance**: In 1637, both British and Dutch attempts to establish permanent settlements were violently repelled by indigenous forces. A Zeeland warship in 1628 lost 54 men in a single encounter with Tobago's warriors.
* **Strategic Alliances**: The Kalinago were adept at playing European powers against each other, often siding with the French or Dutch to undermine British attempts at colonization.
* **The "Neutral" Island**: For much of the 17th century, Tobago was considered too dangerous for permanent European settlement due to the "hostility" of the native population, leading to periods where it was officially declared a neutral territory.

### The Full Arc: Decline and Extinction

The eventual demise of Tobago's first peoples was not the result of a single event but a "perfect storm" of biological, military, and economic factors.

1. **Epidemic Disease**: The most devastating factor was the introduction of Old World diseases such as **smallpox, measles, and influenza**. Lacking any natural immunity, indigenous populations were decimated, sometimes losing 80-90% of their numbers within a single generation.
2. **Constant Warfare**: As Tobago became the most fought-over island in the Caribbean, the indigenous people were caught in the crossfire. The "33 changes of hands" meant constant raids, scorched-earth tactics, and the destruction of native villages.
3. **Enslavement and Displacement**: Many were captured and sold into slavery in other colonies, while others fled to the mainland (South America) or to the "Carib territories" in islands like Dominica and St. Vincent.
4. **Colonial Consolidation**: By the late 18th century, the British had finally established firm control. The remaining indigenous people were either assimilated into the growing population of enslaved Africans and European settlers or marginalized to the point of cultural extinction on the island.

### Legacy

While the "full arc" of their independent history ended in the 18th century, the legacy of the first peoples remains embedded in Tobago’s identity. Archaeological sites at **Milford Road** and **Mount Irvine** continue to yield artifacts that tell the story of their sophisticated craftsmanship. Linguistically, the name of the island itself stands as a permanent monument to the people who first called it home. Today, the **Santa Rosa First Peoples Community** in Arima, Trinidad, serves as the primary custodian of this heritage, representing the descendants of those who survived the colonial era.
