          <h2>About My Caribbean Journey</h2>
          <p>
            The Caribbean's richest treasures are not found on the beach. They live in the stories
            passed down through generations, in the traditions that shape island identity, and in the
            oral traditions that still whisper through the trees at night.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each book in this collection is a love letter to the islands, crafted to preserve and share
            the cultural heritage that defines the Caribbean and connects us across generations.

        <p>
          I was born in Tobago when the island had just one traffic light, and even that was there
          only so children could cross safely to and from the nearby primary school. Some of my most
          vivid childhood memories are of racing down Sangsters Hill in Scarborough, dashing across
          the main road, plunging into the sea, and eating far too many sea grapes until my stomach
          ached, long before a deep-water harbour replaced those simple freedoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent part of my early years in Trinidad before returning home to Tobago at the age of
          nine. I attended Scarborough Methodist Primary School and Bishop's High School, growing up
          immersed in music under the guidance of my paternal grandmother, a revered educator who
          awakened in me a deep love for language, discipline, and storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music became my first language. I played organ and piano for the Scarborough and Bon Accord
          Methodist Churches, performed steel pan at hotels across the island, and played oboe and
          clarinet with the Tobago Youth Orchestra. As a child, I placed third on the nationally
          televised talent competition Aunty Hazel's "12 and Under" as part of a duo with fellow
          Tobagonian Stacy Frith.
        </p>
        <p>
          I later emigrated to Tennessee to study Biology and Medicine at the University of Tennessee,
          but music called me back. I formed a band and spent more than fifteen years touring across
          the United States. In 2017, one of my projects reached the Grammy consideration stage,
          featuring a song I wrote and recorded with pan virtuoso Andy Narell.

          Along the way, I married my wife, opened a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aimees.bohemian/" class="bio-inline-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retail Bohemian store</a> with her, and became a father.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I write and create from the same well of memory and belonging that shaped me as a boy
          in Trinidad and Tobago. My work is rooted in the energy and culture that shaped me, guided by
          the belief that our stories deserve to be told with pride, beauty, and permanence.
